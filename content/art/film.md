Wabi-sabi (侘寂), the traditional Japanese aesthetics that 
focuses on finding beauty within the imperfections and transience,
summarizes the reason why I fall in love with film photography.

With the advance of today's technology, photography is more accessible 
than ever. It is no surprise that anyone on the street has mobile
devices with up to thousands of photos. In comparison, 
film photography is gradually being replaced and consigned to oblivion. 

Arguably, shooting with film does not keep up with the ease of modern life: 
analog cameras don't have the functionality of auto-focus or 
include dozens of Instagram-like filters. It takes countless hours 
to develop and wash films in the dark room, and there is no guarantee how photos
look like until they are revealed after printing under light.

However, I still find certain beauty in the practice of film photography.
With the limitation of only 36 exposures on a roll of film, every 
photo to be captured forms a part of story-telling. There is no instant 
recall, no second chance and no running away from mistakes. Imperfection
will be preserved in chemical form as an extension of history.
