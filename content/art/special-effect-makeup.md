Using prosthetic sculpting, molding and casting techniques to create advanced cosmetic effects;
***Uncomfortable and bloody content alert!***

In 2017 Spring at NYU,
I took Intro to Special Effect Makeup with 
[Robert Benevides](https://tisch.nyu.edu/about/directory/openarts/108252372)
at NYU Tisch Open Arts Curriculum. I learned how to 
mold, cast and paint silicone replica props;
how to apply make-up effects such as cuts,
bruises, scars, wounds, and burned flesh;
and how to design and execute a zombie make up
and how to sculpt a 1:1 animal character maquette.
