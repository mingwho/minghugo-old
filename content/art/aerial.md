A chat with a random stranger on the high speed
rail to Shanghai in 2015 sparkled my 
interest in aerial photography.

When I was traveling to Shanghai in 2015, I talked to a
Russian filmmaker who also happened to be an aerial
photographer in China. During the
half an hour ride, I learned that, until now,
taking stunning imagery with drones has been 
cost prohibitive or impossible to capture.
The technology nowadays has enabled us
to see the world from hundreds of feet height
without a rocketing high cost.
Since then, I have been crazy about drones
and I took my drone everywhere I travelled.
