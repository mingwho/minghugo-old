An interactive gallery experience in partnership with Guggenheim
Abu Dhabi

{{< vimeo 301184055 >}}

#### Background

NYU partnered with Guggenheim Abu Dhabi to develop a VR prototype
of interactive gallery where curators and designers can
experiment the curation of exhibitions in a virtual space. I was
in charge of designing and developing its core interactions, presenting 
the demo
to the curators and managers of Guggenheim, as well as writing
documentations for future development.
