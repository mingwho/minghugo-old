An interactive gallery experience in partnership with Guggenheim
Abu Dhabi

#### Background

After a talk between [Pierre Depaz](https://pierredepaz.net/) and
the curator of Guggenheim Abu Dhabi,
we partnered with Guggenheim Abu Dhabi to develop a VR prototype
of interactive gallery where curators can
experiment with curation in a virtual space. 

#### User and Audience
The target users are curators, interior designers and artists who
want to experiment with curation and exhibitions without going
through the hassle of moving physical art pieces around.

#### Team & Role
This project is a collaboration with [Nicolas White](https://www.facebook.com/nickychristmas) and
mentored by [Pierre Depaz](https://pierredepaz.net/).
I was in charge of designing and developing its core interactions, presenting 
the prototype
to the curators and managers of Guggenheim, as well as writing
documentation for future researchers.
