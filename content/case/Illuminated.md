Illuminated is an adventurous and thrilling first person shooter VR game

#### Okay, so: what is Illuminated?
Illuminated is an adventurous and thrilling first person shooter VR experience. It inverts your expectations on usual shooter games: instead of seeing and shooting the opponents, you have to illuminate the environment to uncover the position of the other players before taking the killing shot.

Playing with the concept of lighting and visibility, Illuminated merges intense action and stealth game play in a novel way. The environment itself is visible but you cannot fully see it. While another person might be present, you cannot see him or her without casting a light either. Illuminated allows you to see part of the environment layout but that’s not the whole picture - pun intended.

#### Why do you use Virtual Reality as the medium?
This project is uniquely suited to VR, as a player’s concept of spatiality is different on a 2D screen than viewing it in real surroundings. VR enables a more intuitive and kinesthetic mode of exploration. Creating a procedural experience, we plan to modify the fundamental ways physics and reality work and we need the immersion of VR to make the experience believable yet refreshing to the player.

Social experience is at the core of Illuminated for a few reasons. First, it is meant to be a competitive experience, so having at least two people engaging in the space is crucial. The main interactions arise between players in conflict, rather than between a player and their environment. Second, while one can explore the environment by oneself, the act of revealing and finding a second player is also central to the game, as it becomes a chase between actors with incomplete information. The tension builds slowly, spiking when another player is finally revealed, before they dart back into the invisible, and the search is on once more.

#### Illuminated Visual Aesthetic Moodboard
We create a low-poly surreal art style, to feed into the emotions of unease and unfamiliarity we wish to evoke in the players. We have used Blender and 3ds Max to make 3D models and texture shaders for lighting mechanisms.

#### Core Interactions
The core interaction revolves around shooting and illuminating the world around you. The two acts are inextricably linked: the act of shooting is bound to the act of illuminating, as each weapon has both its own shooting and illuminating mechanics. You don’t have a weapon and a light: your weapon is the light. When placed in an environment that is featureless unless illuminated, along with other players that are out to hunt you, these linked mechanics mean your strengths and weaknesses are bound to a single action. You need to shoot to hunt the other players, and you need to shoot to light up the space and reveal their positions, but that same light can also expose you and leave you vulnerable. Given that player are individual actors avoiding one another, the act of searching the space with your light will always be a tense and rewarding interaction, for at any moment you can find your next target - or they can find you.

#### What kind of experience or emotion do I get playing Illuminated?
By flipping one of physical reality’s core rules around, we are forcing the player(s) into an experience where they must re-learn how to interact with the world under the tension of being constantly hunted. We aim to encourage competitive play where the winner is the last player standing. In order to encourage active play, we will penalize players who spend too long wondering in one place or not initializing any illumination.

Our space is designed to reflect a relatable environment. It withholds its characters unless lit up by the characters. We want to ease the players into familiarity with Illuminated rules slowly: the more they explore what seems to be an abstract world, the more they understand the world better and come out on top.
