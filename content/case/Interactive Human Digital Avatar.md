A bilingual (Arabic-English) conversational avatar, similar to a chat bot, except that the avatar is based on pre-recorded videos of an actual human being.
 
The system is designed to allow anybody, simply using a laptop, to create an avatar of themselves.  As an interactive tool,  TOIA can serve as a conversational medium of story telling, thus enabling cross-cultural and cross-generational sharing and preservation of stories.  

This project was presented at the National Exhibition Center
 of Abu Dhabi, and Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue
 (SIGDIAL) Conference
 in Melbourne 2018. The [project paper](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W18-5027) is published on ACL.
