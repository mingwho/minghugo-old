A VR experience that takes you on a gliding journey across mountains
and valleys to plant seeds and create euphoric soundscape.

{{< vimeo 301179904 >}}

Inspired by the classic Japanese anime Nausicaä of the 
Valley of the Wind, Aria brings fantasy of gliding through mountains 
into reality. With simple controls on the Vive trackpads, 
you can rotate left and right, glide up and down, and plant
forests in a low-poly peaceful world.


#### Background
![](/images/case/nausicaa.png)

Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind explores an apocalyptic 
conflict between human and nature which devastated
world's ecosystem in the far future. The young heroine Nausicaä bears on her
shoulders the responsibility to communicate with other
species and bring peace back to the ravaged planet.

The Japanese anime carries a strong eco message which cautions the audience of 
future generation against the danger of exploiting earth without control. With 
a similar environmental initiative in mind, we decided to work on this VR project that simulates
a gliding experience that encourages audience to grow trees on barren mountain 
terrain. The anime's atmosphere is gloomy and stressful, and we
decided to go for a joyful and peaceful tone instead. 

#### User and Audience

The target users of Aria are anyone who wants to explore
 soothing and relaxing surroundings and cultivate environmental awareness. 


#### Team & Role
Having had previous experience designing a VR experience from the
ground up, I teamed up with 3 other developers at NYU Abu Dhabi to build
this project.

I coordinated and led all facets of design and development including: interaction design,
visual design, audio design, 3D modeling and core mechanism development. 
I also conducted user research using methods such as play-testing
and participatory design in order to address both user behavior and attitudes.

#### Environment and Model Design
![](/images/case/models.png)
In order to create a sense of wonder and detachment
from material reality, we designed the environment
and 3D models with a nostalgic low-poly aesthetic.
We chose the color palette of light blue and green
for a soothing and calming finish. The terrain was designed to be a
size for a ten-minute exploration with boundaries to
signify end of world. We also designed a tall standing pike in the terrain
to attract the audience and glide around it.

A small bonus has been hidden in the map for anyone who is
brave enough to hit the ground. He will trespass
the boundary of earth and encounter
a greyscale upside down world, equally breath-taking, while gliding.

#### Gliding Mechanism Design

When we were designing the gliding mechanism, we faced
the physical constraints of Vive controllers. While an
actual glider model would ask the audience to stand on it
and hold onto the handles on both sides of their body,
it is albeit hard to simulate this experience with two
normal-shaped controllers. We started off by using the trackpads
as main input source for gliding. So the touch point
on both trackpads would determine the direction of the glider: swiping to the left or right sides on the trackpads would
lead to a left or right turn on the glider.

As we were doing research on how other projects
use controllers to navigate space, as well as learning from user
feedback, we decided to develop a very different gliding mechanism.
We wanted the audience to feel like they are turning
the glider when they move their arms in a certain
direction, as if what they would do standing on actual
gliders and turning with two handles.
So with this update, the user can turn to the left side
by simply raising his or her right hand (or lowering the left
hand). Immediately, the glider will enter a very smooth and precise turn.


#### Interaction Design

Beyonds the joy of gliding, we incorporated
other forms of interaction to encourage
creativity. When audience
start this journey, they will see an instruction
on how to glide, how to accelerate or decelerate,
and how to calibre controllers. As they glide
through the terrain, they will be able to pull
the trigger on controllers and shoot different
seeds onto the ground to grow forest on a terrain. 
They can also look back and check the trail to see
they are coming from. By giving users immediate visual and audio feedbacks
upon action, we aimed to create a highly interactive
experience.

#### Outcome

Aria was exhibited in End of Semester Show
at NYUAD Interactive Media program with hundreds of attendants.
We are currently further improving it and submitting
it to major VR festivals and events.
