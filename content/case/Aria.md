A virtual reality experience that takes you on a gliding journey across mountains
and valleys to plant seeds and create euphoric soundscape.

Inspired by the classic Japanese anime Nausicaä of the 
Valley of the Wind, Aria brings fantasy of gliding through mountains 
into reality. With simple controls on the Vive trackpads, 
you can rotate left and right, glide up and down, and plant
forests in a low-poly peaceful world.


#### Background

Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind explores an apocalyptic 
conflict between human and nature which devastated
world's ecosystem in the far future. The young heroine Nausicaä bears on her
shoulders the responsibility to communicate with other
species and bring peace back to the ravaged planet.

The Japanese anime carries a strong eco message which cautions the audience of 
future generation against the danger of exploiting earth without control. With 
a similar goal in mind, we decided to work on this VR project that simulates
a gliding experience that encourages audience to grow trees on barren mountain 
terrain. The movie's atmosphere is gloomy and stressful, but we
decided to go for a joyful and peaceful tone that supports freedom of exploration.
