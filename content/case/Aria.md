A VR experience that takes you on a gliding journey across mountains
and valleys to plant seeds and create euphoric soundscape.

Inspired by the classic Japanese anime Nausicaä of the 
Valley of the Wind, Aria brings fantasy of gliding through mountains 
into reality. With simple controls on the Vive trackpads, 
you can rotate left and right, glide up and down, and plant
forests in a low-poly peaceful world.


#### Background
![](/images/case/nausicaa.png)

Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind explores an apocalyptic 
conflict between human and nature which devastated
world's ecosystem in the far future. The young heroine Nausicaä bears on her
shoulders the responsibility to communicate with other
species and bring peace back to the ravaged planet.

The Japanese anime carries a strong eco message which cautions the audience of 
future generation against the danger of exploiting earth without control. With 
a similar environmental initiative in mind, we decided to work on this VR project that simulates
a gliding experience that encourages audience to grow trees on barren mountain 
terrain. The anime's atmosphere is gloomy and stressful, and we
decided to go for a joyful and peaceful tone instead. 

#### User and Audience

The target users of Aria are anyone who wants to explore
 soothing and relaxing surroundings and cultivate environmental awareness. 


#### Team & Role
Having had previous experience designing a VR experience from the
ground up, I teamed up with 3 other developers to build
this project.

I coordinated and led all facets of design and development including: interaction design,
visual design, audio design, 3D modeling and core mechanism development. 
I also conducted user research using methods such as play-testing
and participatory design in order to address both user behavior and attitudes.
