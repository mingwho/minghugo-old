A robotic telepresence research project that allows you
to move around the robot and explore a remote space from your phone.

A simple motorized platform with an on-board Linux computer (Raspberry Pi) and bidirectional audio and video capabilities (screen/camera, loudspeaker/microphone).

The computer runs a web server. Remote visitors access the robot's URL (e.g. from a browser on their phone) and are are presented with a basic teleconferencing system:
the image from the camera on the robot is visible on the screen of the phone. Similarly with the audio.

#### Team & Role
This project is in collaboration with Professor [Michael Shiloh](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/arts-and-humanities/faculty/michael-shiloh.html).
I was in charge of researching the literature review of telepresence
robot projects, designing and developing the user interface,
conducting user testing and writing project documentation.
