A robotic telepresence research project that allows you
to move around the robot and explore a remote space from your phone.

A simple motorized platform with an on-board Linux computer (Raspberry Pi) and bidirectional audio and video capabilities (screen/camera, loudspaker/microphone).

The computer runs a web server. Remote visitors access the robot's URL (e.g. from a browser on their phone) and are are presented with a basic teleconferencing system:
the image from the camera on the robot is visible on the screen of the phone. Similarly with the audio.
