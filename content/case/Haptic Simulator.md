A prototype dental haptic simulator for periodontal training.



#### Background

The Haptics-based virtual reality periodontal training
 simulation project focuses upon the research, 
 development, and evaluation of a simulator for 
 training of periodontal procedures for dental students/clinicians.


In current periodontal trainings, dental students
often use real-life physical models to learn the structure
of teeth and treatments for different diseases.
It can be sometimes hard to comprehend the situation from 
inside out due the limitations of real-life
models. For example, dental students won't be provided
with all types of physical models to diagnose different diseases
due the cost of making different customized models.

 Using virtual reality and Haptics technologies, 
 the periodontal simulator allows trainees to 
 learn performing diagnosis and/or treatment 
 procedures of periodontal diseases by 
 visualizing a 3D virtual human mouth and 
 feeling physical tactile sensations as they 
 touch the surface of teeth, gingiva, bone and 
 calculi via virtual dental instruments. 
 In a periodontal procedure, the dentist depends 
 primarily on tactile sensations to perform diagnostic
  and surgical tasks, therefore, 
  the use of Haptics in unquestionably crucial 
  for a realistic periodontal simulation.

#### Team & Role

This project is an on-going research at NYUAD's [Applied
Interactive Multi-Media](https://wp.nyu.edu/aimlab/) in collaboration with the 
[NYU College of Dentistry](https://dental.nyu.edu/). 
I was in charge of developing 3D models
for periodontal pockets, the infected spaces teeth and healthy
gum, using 3D model software including Autodesk 3ds Max and Maya. 
With the 3D models we developed, the cost and time required for trainees to understand different
scenarios are cut down significantly and
learning retention rate will be increased.


#### Pockets 3D Model

Periodontal pockets indicate the presence of an abnormal
depth of gingival sulcus near the point at which teeth
get into touch with the gingival tissue. I developed
the 3D models of pockets of different severeness near different positions
around the teeth. These 3D models together with
haptic feedbacks will enable trainees to understand and master
the technique of diagnosing infected areas.
